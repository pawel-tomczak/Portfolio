# Portfolio case study (in progress)

## This case study exemplifies the types of challenges I have addressed using data across various projects.

Its purpose is to showcase:
* The key processes I use to solve business problems with data, focusing on generating actionable insights that support product-related decision making.
* My technical expertise in data analysis (e.g., SQL, Python).
* My approach to product analytics, which integrates product data, surveys, and UX research, all aligned with clear business KPIs.

## Case study sections (WIP)
* Defining the problem
* Approach overview
* Data sources
* Data extraction and preparation
* Initial data analysis and required research
* Key conclusions and feature recommendations
* New features impact assessment
* Selecting best ML classifier for feature personalisation

## Defining the problem
Company and product overview
Key goal
Aligning on the business objectives (?)

## Approach overview
Framework for proper analytics
New business question -> Existing data analysis -> Supplementary research and new data  gathering -> results and recommendations -> New business questionâ€¦

## Data sources
Database scheme
Survey data structure
Strategy for data processing (SQL to prepare the database data, ingest into Python, merge with survey data, perform crucial visualisations and tests)

## Data extraction and preparation
SQL queries to get the right metrics (join, aggregate, etc.)
Python ingestion, survey data join)

## Initial data analysis and required research
Conclusions, implications, required metrics to make better recommendations
IDI / survey example

## Final data analysis, conclusions, and feature recommendations

## New features impact assessment
Causal inference: RCT (A/B test), synthetic control (two approaches)

## Selecting best ML classifier for feature personalisation
Based on the results, different user segments require different variant of the feature - personalisation
